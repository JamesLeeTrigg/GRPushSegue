# GRPushSegue

A custom NSStoryboardSegue to make a nice iOS-like push transition.

This only works on OS X 10.10 and later, only in projects with storyboards. If you're targeting earlier versions you can use [GRNavigationController](https://github.com/insidegui/GRNavigationController).

## How To

Just set your segue type to "custom" and set the class to GRPushSegue, see the included demo project.
